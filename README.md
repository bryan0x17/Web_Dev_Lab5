SAIT Web Development (CPRG256) Lab Assignment 5: JavaScript Event Handling

Part A:

Create a page that converts 4 different measurements (i.e. length, volume, area, distance) to either Imperial or Metric values. When a value is entered into one of the fields, the converted amount is displayed in the other corresponding field. 

Example: 

Converting between litres and gallons. If you enter 25 for gallons, the value of 113.50 litres should be displayed.

Converting between gallons and litres. If you enter 75 litres, the value of 16.52 gallons should be displayed. (Note, 1 Imperial gallon is 4.54 litres)

Example: 

Converting between metres and feet. If you enter 125 for feet, the value of 38.10 metres should be displayed.

Example:

Converting square metres to feet. If you enter 95 for square metres, the value of 1022.57 square feet should be displayed.

Your page will require JavaScript ‘event handlers’ that will respond to changes in the number field and call the correct functions. Your answers should display to 2 significant digits.

Your page must use CSS to create an interesting and pleasing interface.

Part B:

Refer to Part B from your Week 2 Lab Exercise ‘Vacation or Recreation Page’. Modify the HTML and include JavaScript code that displays or hides the title of the picture when the picture is clicked.
